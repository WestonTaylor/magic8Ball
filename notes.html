<!-- Begin your final project:

Main objectives:
    Create an input field for users to ask a question
        have a form field for an a question to be put in

    Create a label for your input field telling your user to "Ask me anything!"
        make placeholder text say "Ask me Anything!"

    Create an "ask" button (this will run the function that outputs a random magic 8 ball image)
        make an ask button that on click returns a random 8ball image

    Create a div with an id of "answers" that you will insert the images into using js
        Make a (hidden?) div within the js with the 8ball images as answers

    Create an "ask" function that when clicked, will choose a random 8ball image and insert it into your "answers" div
        on askbutton click have it select an image at random

    Replace the input field with the user's question when displaying the answer
        when displaying the asnwer from button click, have the ask me anything field display the question/text inserted

    Style your page any way you like

    Activate Github Pages for your project

<!-- 
    form field with a placeholder of "ask me anything"
    ask button that on click will display a random 8ball image which is stored in an answers div, and will display the question entered
 -->

<!-- probelms to solve
        create a function that will have the images cycling thorugh, and appear to pluck one on button click
        have a way to store the answers while still clearing the input field
-->

<!-- 
    answers, 
    concatenate the random number generated as the final number in the string for the image url.

 -->

 <!-- // askButton2.innerText = 'I have the answers. The question is do you want to hear them?'; -->
