<!-- Begin your final project:

Main objectives:

    Replace the input field with the user's question when displaying the answer
        when displaying the asnwer from button click, have the ask me anything field display the question/text inserted

    Style your page any way you like

    Activate Github Pages for your project 
-->

<!-- 
    form field with a placeholder of "ask me anything"
    ask button that on click will display a random 8ball image which is stored in an answers div, and will display the question entered
 -->

<!-- probelms to solve
        create a function that will have the images cycling thorugh, and appear to pluck one on button click
        have a way to store the answers while still clearing the input field
-->

<!-- 
    answers, 
    concatenate the random number generated as the final number in the string for the image url.

 -->

 <!-- // askButton2.innerText = 'I have the answers. The question is do you want to hear them?'; -->

 <!-- 
     have 8ball images cycle through, then type question, press ask button, one new image will be appended over, input field will be replaced with a new div contiainting their response, nect to that will be a go again button, on that reset to before but new placeholder with the question asnwer type motif.
        idea: have button presss erhulate that there is ingo in the input field.
